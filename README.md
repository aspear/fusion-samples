# VMware Fusion Samples
This repo contains samples that show usage of the VMware Fusion REST API.

You can find programming resources for the VMware Fusion REST API on the VMware {code} site : [https://code.vmware.com/apis/218/fusion](https://code.vmware.com/apis/218/fusion) including REST reference, Getting Started Guide, and links to other samples.  The getting started guide contains instructions on how you can enable the REST API server in your copy of Fusion.  

Note that anyone, meaning you, can contribute better samples for VMware Fusion on https://code.vmware.com/samples.  When you create them, put a tag value of "VMware Fusion API" on the Sample it it will magically show up in the API Explorer as well!
